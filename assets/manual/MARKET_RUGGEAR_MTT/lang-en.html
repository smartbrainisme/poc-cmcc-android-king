	<strong>Main function</strong><br/><br/>
	<li>G&T introduction <br/><br/>
	G&T, Geo & Talking is an innovative technology provided by M.T.T. which allows you to communicate with one or several contacts instantaneously through the GPRS / EDGE / 3G / Wi-Fi networks and to pinpoint your mobile phone with its GPS module.
	</li><br/>
	<li>Login<br/><br/>
	The M.T.T. SmartMax is fitted with a G&T shortcut key: when the SmartMax is on the standby mode, a mere click on that key will launch the G&T function. <br/>
	Each SmartMax model has a unique G&T account: login to your account by entering your username and password (default password is: 123456).

	
	</li><br/>

	<li>Automatic login<br/><br/>
	When you exit the G&T function, you can select “Automatic connection” in order to be automatically connected in the future. The G&T also allows an automatic connection even when your account is disconnected: if you receive a call, the SmartMax will automatically connect you to the G&T in the background mode but you won’t receive any invitation for this call. For the next calls, you will receive an invitation to call. 

	</li><br/>
	

	<li>Instant group chat <br/><br/>
	
	Once you are connected, click on <img src="images/icon_1.jpg" />  to display the groups list generated by the G&T Manager. Select the group to which you want to be connected to see all the contacts existing in the group (connected or not). If the chat is “Idle”, long press the G&T key and when you hear a “bip”, it means that you can start talking. 
If the chat is busy because one of the contacts is talking, you can press the G&T key in order to be added to the waiting list automatically (the function needs to be activated in the G&T Manager): you can start talking as soon as one of the contacts finishes. To remain in the waiting list, long press the G&T key. To exit the waiting list, release the G&T key.  
Press <img src="images/icon_3.jpg" />  or <img src="images/icon_4.jpg" />  to switch between the receiver and the loudspeaker

	</li><br/>


	<li>Text/Vocal message<br/><br/>
	If the contacts that are connected are unable to receive your instant messages, you can leave them a text/vocal message: as soon as your contacts are connected again, they will receive your messages. 
Press  <img src="images/icon_5.jpg" />    or scroll the screen to the left to switch on the text/vocal message mode. Press  <img src="images/icon_6.jpg" />    to add a picture, a smiley or to enter a text message in the text field: <img src="images/icon_7.jpg" />   ; or, click on  <img src="images/icon_8.jpg" />   to leave a vocal message. <br/>
	On this page, you will be able to check all your instant vocal messages and your text/vocal messages that you have received. For that, click on  <img src="images/icon_9.jpg" />    to check all your messages again.

	</li><br/>

	<li>One-time chat with one or several contacts <br/><br/>
	You can create a one-time chat with one or several contacts existing in the same group: select the contacts you want to talk to and press “Call” to invite them to join the chat. During the chat, you can invite more contacts by pressing  <img src="images/icon_10.jpg" />  , then select the new contacts and press  <img src="images/icon_11.jpg" />   to confirm.
	</li><br/>
	<li>Call the G&T Call Center<br/><br/>
	You can call the G&T Call Center by clicking on “Call Center”, which is on the top of your contact list
	</li><br/>
	<li>Pinpoint your mobile phone<br/><br/>
	The SmartMax comes with a G&T phone localization module. See the “Localization settings” to activate or deactivate the GPS module and set the synchronization frequency with the G&T Manager. 
	</li><br/>
	<li>Send a picture to the G&T Call Center<br/><br/>
	Take a picture or select one image from the Album to send it to the G&T Call Center.
